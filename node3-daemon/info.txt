Run the /usr/bin/dockerd command from the command line, incase you experience problems. 
I got an  error when i tried to restart the docker.service, which was caused by not renaming the certificates in the
~/.docker folder. I had to run the "/usr/bin/dockerd -H tcp://node3:2376" command to see the error.

Also make sure that you have renamed the certifcate files:
client-key.pem to key.pem
client-cert.pem to cert.pem
daemon-key.pem to key.pem
daemon-cert.pem to cert.pem

Also make sure that you have added the certificates to the ~/.docker folder
Don't forget the daemon.json file and to run the "systemctl edit docker" command
